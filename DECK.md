# Tarot Deck Specification v1.0

> Maintained by [Arcana Land](https://github.com/arcanaland).

## Overview
This specification defines a standard format for tarot decks used by tarot applications. The format is designed to:

- Separate **presentation** (images, names) from **interpretation** (meanings, readings).
- Support internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n).
- Allow flexibility for suit and court card renaming.
- Support extensions for decks with extra or missing cards.
- Ensure compatibility with **esoterica files**, which provide meanings, divination aids, and interpretive details (see [Tarot Esoterica Specification](https://github.com/arcanaland/specifications/blob/main/ESOTERICA.md)), while this specification covers presentation only.
 
Decks must be delivered as a directory with a mandatory `deck.toml` file at the root.

---

## Schema Versioning
- This specification introduces a **schema version number** to ensure compatibility and future extensibility.
- The schema version is specified in the `deck.toml` file under `[deck]` as `schema_version`.

## deck.toml Schema

### Common Fields

```toml
[deck]
id = "rider-waite-smith"         # Required: Unique identifier
schema_version = "1.0"           # Required: Schema version (this document)
name = "Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot" # Required: Human readable name
version = "1.0"                  # Required: Deck version
icon = "deck-icon.png"           # Optional: deck preview image
author = "Pamela Colman Smith"   # Optional
license = "Public Domain"        # Optional
aspect_ratio = 0.5789            # Optional; default 11:19
description = "The classic Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck, first published in 1909." # Optional

# Additional optional metadata
created_date = "1909-12-01"      # Original creation date
updated_date = "2025-01-15"      # Last update date
publisher = "US Games Systems"   # Publisher information
website = "https://example.com/rws-deck" # Website for the deck
tags = ["traditional", "classic", "beginner-friendly"] # Categorization tags
```

### Card Back Configuration

```toml
[card_backs]
default = "classic"              # Required if multiple variants are defined

# Define each card back variant
[card_backs.variants.classic]
name = "Classic RWS Back"        # Human-readable name
image = "card_backs/classic.png" # Path to the card back image
description = "The original blue and white rose pattern back" # Optional description
alt_text = "A blue and white geometric pattern featuring roses and lilies" # Optional alt text
```

This structure allows decks to provide multiple card back options while maintaining a clear default choice. Card backs can have different dimensions and formats from the card fronts, and may be provided in multiple variants without duplicating the entire deck.

### Optional Presentation Aliases

```toml
[aliases.suits]
wands = "Staves"
pentacles = "Disks"

[aliases.courts]
page = "Princess"
knight = "Prince"
queen = "Queen"
king = "Knight"
```

### Optional Major Arcana Remapping

```toml
[remap_major_arcana]
08 = "justice"  # Swap Justice to 8
11 = "strength" # Swap Strength to 11
```

### Optional Excluded Cards

```toml
[deck.excluded_cards]
# List cards that are intentionally excluded from this deck
cards = [
  "minor_arcana.pentacles.page",
  "minor_arcana.pentacles.knight"
]
reason = "This historical Tarocchi deck excludes these court cards."
```

### Optional Custom Cards and Dynamic Card Groups

Custom cards or groups of cards can be defined under `[custom_cards]`. This allows for decks with entirely new suits or additional major arcana.

```toml
[custom_cards]
# Add a completely new card to major arcana
[custom_cards.major_arcana.happy_squirrel]
id = "happy_squirrel"  # This will be referenced as major_arcana.happy_squirrel
name = "The Happy Squirrel"
image = "scalable/major_arcana/happy_squirrel.svg"
alt_text = "A cheerful squirrel gathering acorns, representing preparation and unexpected joy."
position = 22  # Optional - indicates position in sequence after traditional cards

# Add an entire new suit
[custom_cards.minor_arcana.stars]
name = "Stars"
cards = [
  { id = "ace", name = "Ace of Stars", image = "scalable/minor_arcana/stars/ace.svg" },
  { id = "two", name = "Two of Stars", image = "scalable/minor_arcana/stars/two.svg" },
  # ... and so on
]
```

It is recommended to use the internationalization files (`names/*.toml`) for alt text to support localization. The `alt_text` field in custom cards definitions serves as a fallback or default.

### Optional Deck Variants

For decks that have multiple editions or variants sharing the same card fronts:

```toml
[variants]
# Define deck variants that share the same card fronts
[variants.standard]
id = "rider-waite-smith-standard"
name = "Rider-Waite-Smith (Standard)"
card_back = "classic"  # References card_backs.variants.classic
publisher = "US Games Systems"

[variants.rider_edition]
id = "rider-waite-smith-rider"
name = "Rider-Waite-Smith (Rider Edition)"
card_back = "rider"    # References card_backs.variants.rider
publisher = "Rider & Company"
created_date = "1912-01-01"
```

---

## Canonical ID and File Behavior

Cards are referenced internally using **canonical IDs**, which are the only official way to identify cards in this specification:

- Major Arcana: `major_arcana.00` to `major_arcana.21`
- Minor Arcana: `minor_arcana.<suit>.<rank>` where:
  - `<suit>`: `wands`, `cups`, `swords`, `pentacles`
  - `<rank>`: `ace`, `two`, ..., `ten`, `page`, `knight`, `queen`, `king`

All references to cards in the specification, including configuration files, custom cards, and i18n files must use these canonical IDs.

### File-Location-Based Defaults
Applications are designed to **automatically detect and use files** placed in the expected directory structure without requiring additional configuration. For example:
- Dropping an image into `h1200/minor_arcana/wands/ace.png` will automatically map it to the card with the canonical ID `minor_arcana.wands.ace`.

This ensures that creating a deck can be as simple as placing files into the correct folders.

## Image Formats and Technical Requirements

### Vector Graphics
- SVG is the only supported vector format
- Vector graphics should be placed in the `scalable/` directory

### Raster Graphics
- Recommended formats: PNG (preferred), JPEG, WebP
- Recommended resolutions: h750, h1200, h2400 (height in pixels)
- Each resolution should have its own directory (e.g., `h750/`, `h1200/`, `h2400/`)
- PNG with alpha channel recommended for images requiring transparency

#### Resolution Usage Guidelines
- **h750**: Use for mobile applications, thumbnails, and low-bandwidth environments
- **h1200**: Use for standard web viewing, most desktop applications, and tablets
- **h2400**: Use for high-resolution displays, printing, and when fine details need to be preserved

### Card Back Images
- Placed in the `card_backs/` directory
- Can use any supported image format
- May have different dimensions and aspect ratios from the card fronts
- Applications must handle card backs appropriately, preserving their exact dimensions

### ANSI Art
- ANSI art is supported for terminal-based tarot applications.
- Files should be stored in the `ansi<lines>/` directory, organized by card type and suit (e.g., `ansi32/major_arcana/00.ansi`).
- Each ANSI art file should represent a single card.
- **Line Recommendation**: ANSI art should consider using 32 lines for improved readability in terminal applications.
- ANSI files must use the `.ansi` extension and follow the same canonical ID structure as other formats (e.g., `major_arcana.00` for The Fool).

Applications should treat ANSI art as an optional format, falling back to other image formats if ANSI files are not provided.

## Aspect Ratio

- Standard assumed aspect ratio is **11:19** (~0.5789).
- Raster folders are named `h<height>/`, e.g., `h750/`, `h1200/`.
- Applications must preserve the aspect ratio when scaling images.

---

## Internationalization

- Localized names and alt text go into `names/<lang>.toml`, e.g., `names/en.toml`.
- Structure mirrors canonical IDs:

```toml
# Card name localization
[major_arcana]
00 = "The Fool"
01 = "The Magician"
# ...

[minor_arcana.wands]
ace = "Ace of Wands"
two = "Two of Wands"
# ...

# Alt text localization - this is where ALL alt text should be defined
[alt_text.major_arcana]
00 = "A young person in colorful clothes steps off a cliff, carrying a white rose. A small dog jumps at their heels."
01 = "A figure standing at a table with the four suit symbols, one hand raised toward the sky, the other pointing to the ground."
# ...

[alt_text.minor_arcana.wands]
ace = "A hand emerging from a cloud holds a flowering wooden staff."
two = "A figure in a flowing robe stands on a cliff holding two staves, looking out over the sea."
# ...

# Card back alt text (optional)
[alt_text.card_backs]
classic = "A blue and white geometric pattern featuring roses and lilies"
alternative = "A starry night sky pattern with gold accents"
```

### Alt Text Guidelines

- **Alt text is always defined in the internationalization files** (`names/*.toml`), not in the main deck.toml file
- Alt text should describe the visual elements of the card without interpretation
- For the standard Rider Waite Smith deck, comprehensive alt text should be included in the default language file
- Every deck should include at least one language file with alt text for accessibility
- Alt text for custom cards follows the same pattern in the localization files, using the custom card's canonical ID
- If alt text is provided in the `custom_cards` section, it should be considered a fallback only

For any card without a localized name or alt text, applications should use the names and alt text from the default deck (most likely rider-waite-smith).

## Esoterica File Compatibility

While this specification focuses exclusively on presentation aspects of tarot decks, it provides a foundation for companion esoterica files through a standardized mapping system.

### Esoterica Files

Esoterica files follow the [Tarot Esoterica Specification](https://github.com/arcanaland/specifications/blob/main/ESOTERICA.md):

1. They reference the same canonical IDs used in this specification
2. They can be deck-specific or generic
3. They can include meanings, elemental associations, astrological correspondences, etc.

### Mapping System for Non-Standard Decks

To ensure esoterica files can work with non-standard decks:

1. **Aliases**: The `[aliases]` section in deck.toml provides information for converting between non-standard and standard naming conventions
2. **Remapping**: The `[remap_major_arcana]` section maps cards that have different positions in the sequence
3. **Custom Cards**: Custom cards defined in deck.toml can have custom interpretations in esoterica files

### Example of Esoterica Mapping (In Esoterica Files)

```toml
# This would be in an esoterica file, not in deck.toml
[esoterica]
schema_version = "1.0"
name = "Traditional RWS Meanings"
compatible_decks = ["rider-waite-smith", "cosmic-tarot"]

# Standard mappings section that links non-standard names to canonical IDs
[esoterica.card_mappings]
"minor_arcana.torches.prince" = "minor_arcana.wands.knight"
"minor_arcana.disks.princess" = "minor_arcana.pentacles.page"
"major_arcana.adjustment" = "major_arcana.11"  # Thoth's Justice equivalent

# Custom cards have their own dedicated interpretations
[esoterica.custom_cards.major_arcana.happy_squirrel]
keywords = ["surprise", "playfulness", "hidden resources"]
upright_meaning = "Unexpected resources and opportunities appearing in your life"
reversed_meaning = "Missing opportunities due to lack of awareness"
```

---

## Validation Rules

Applications should validate the following:

1. **Required Files**:
   - `deck.toml` must exist and adhere to the schema.
   - All referenced images and name files must exist.

2. **Canonical ID Mapping**:
   - Ensure all canonical IDs referenced in `deck.toml` have corresponding images in the defined directories.

3. **Localization Validation**:
   - Verify that all localization files have consistent structures and no missing translations for required fields.
   - Verify that alt text is provided for all cards in at least one language file.

4. **Card Back Validation**:
   - If card back variants are defined, verify that the default card back exists.
   - Verify that all referenced card back image files exist.

---

## Licensing and Attribution

- A `license` field should be included in `deck.toml` to indicate the deck's licensing terms.
- Attribution requirements must be specified (if any):

```toml
[deck]
license = "CC-BY-SA-4.0"
attribution = "Artwork by Pamela Colman Smith (Public Domain)."
```

---

## Extensibility for Applications

- A reserved namespace `[app]` allows applications to include custom configurations without conflicts:

```toml
[app.my_tarot_app]
default_layout = "grid"
favorite_cards = ["major_arcana.00", "minor_arcana.wands.ace"]
```

---

## Examples

### Rider Waite Smith

```toml
# deck.toml
[deck]
id = "rider-waite-smith"
name = "Rider-Waite-Smith"
version = "1.0"
author = "Pamela Colman Smith"
license = "Public Domain (original artwork), CC0 (digital restoration)"
attribution = "Original artwork by Pamela Colman Smith (1909). Digital restoration by Luciella Elisabeth Scarlett."
description = "The classic Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck, first published in 1909."
schema_version = "1.0"
created_date = "1909-12-01"
updated_date = "2025-04-28"
publisher = "Original: US Games Systems, Digital: Luciella Elisabeth Scarlett"
website = "https://luciellaes.itch.io/rider-waite-smith-tarot-cards-cc0"
tags = ["traditional", "classic", "beginner-friendly"]

# Card back configuration
[card_backs]
default = "classic"

[card_backs.variants.classic]
name = "Classic RWS Back"
image = "card_backs/classic.png"
description = "Card back design provided by Luciella Elisabeth Scarlett"

# Link to compatible esoterica files
[deck.companions]
esoterica = [
  { id = "waite-meanings", name = "A.E. Waite's Original Meanings", uri = "https://arcana.land/esoterica/waite-rws.toml" },
  { id = "golden-dawn", name = "Golden Dawn Attributions", uri = "https://arcana.land/esoterica/golden-dawn.toml" }
]

# Note that card definitions rely on the canonical file structure
# and canonical IDs (major_arcana.00, etc.) rather than being explicitly defined here
```
With names and alt text in `names/en.toml`:
```toml
# Card name localization
[major_arcana]
00 = "The Fool"
01 = "The Magician"
02 = "The High Priestess"
# ... and so on

[minor_arcana.wands]
ace = "Ace of Wands"
two = "Two of Wands"
# ... and so on

# Alt text localization
[alt_text.major_arcana]
00 = "A young person in colorful clothes steps off a cliff, carrying a white rose. A small dog jumps at their heels."
01 = "A figure standing at a table with the four suit symbols, one hand raised toward the sky, the other pointing to the ground."
02 = "A robed female figure sits between two pillars, one black and one white, with a crescent moon at her feet."
# ... and so on

[alt_text.minor_arcana.wands]
ace = "A hand emerging from a cloud holds a flowering wooden staff."
two = "A figure in a flowing robe stands on a cliff holding two staves, looking out over the sea."
# ... and so on

# Card back alt text
[alt_text.card_backs]
classic = "A blue and white geometric pattern with a rose design in the center"
```

### Simple Custom Deck 

This spec is designed so that creating a custom deck should only require creating a minimal `deck.toml` file with your card images placed in a reasonable directory structure.

```
my-custom-deck/
  deck.toml
  card_backs/
    main.png
  h1200/
    major_arcana/
      00.png          # The Fool
      01.png          # The Magician
      ...
      21.png          # The World
    minor_arcana/
      wands/
        ace.png
        two.png
        ...
        king.png
      cups/
        ace.png
        ...
  names/
    en.toml           # Contains both card names and alt text
```

By following this structure and file-naming convention, applications can **automatically detect the images** and map them to the correct cards based on their canonical IDs.


### Custom Deck with Non-Standard Names and Multiple Card Backs

This example shows a complex custom deck with custom suits, a new custom major arcana card and multiple card backs.

```toml
# deck.toml
[deck]
id = "elemental-torches"
name = "Elemental Torches Tarot"
author = "Fire Sage"
version = "1.0"
schema_version = "1.0"
description = "A fire-themed tarot deck with renamed suits and additional elemental cards."
created_date = "2025-01-01"
website = "https://example.com/elemental-torches"
tags = ["elemental", "fire-themed"]

# Card back configuration with multiple variants
[card_backs]
default = "flames"

[card_backs.variants.flames]
name = "Flame Pattern"
image = "card_backs/flames.png"
description = "A dynamic pattern of red and orange flames"

[card_backs.variants.embers]
name = "Glowing Embers"
image = "card_backs/embers.png"
description = "A dark background with smoldering red embers"

# These aliases help esoterica files map to standard meanings
[aliases.suits]
wands = "Torches"
cups = "Waters" 
swords = "Winds"
pentacles = "Stones"

[aliases.courts]
page = "Student"
knight = "Warrior"
queen = "Priestess"
king = "Master"

# Add a custom elemental card
[custom_cards.major_arcana.elemental_force]
id = "elemental_force"
name = "The Elemental Force"
image = "scalable/major_arcana/elemental_force.svg"
alt_text = "A vortex of the four elements swirling together in perfect harmony."
position = 22

# Link to a dedicated esoterica file for this deck
[deck.companions]
esoterica = [
  { id = "elemental-meanings", name = "Elemental Torches Esoterica", uri = "https://arcana.land/esoterica/elemental-torches.toml" }
]

# Define deck variants with different card backs
[variants]
[variants.standard]
id = "elemental-torches-standard"
name = "Elemental Torches (Standard Edition)"
card_back = "flames"

[variants.deluxe]
id = "elemental-torches-deluxe"
name = "Elemental Torches (Deluxe Edition)"
card_back = "embers"
```

And the alt-text in `names/en.toml`:
```toml
# Standard card names follow canonical IDs
[major_arcana]
00 = "The Wanderer" # Custom name for The Fool
01 = "The Alchemist" # Custom name for The Magician
# ... and so on

# Custom names for suits that match the aliases in deck.toml
[minor_arcana.wands]
ace = "Ace of Torches"
two = "Two of Torches"
# ... and so on

# Alt text for standard cards
[alt_text.major_arcana]
00 = "A traveler with a backpack walks toward a fiery mountain, unaware of the cliff edge ahead."
01 = "A figure in red robes manipulates the four elemental symbols above a workbench filled with alchemical tools."
# ... and so on

# Alt text for custom cards
[alt_text.major_arcana.elemental_force]
elemental_force = "A vortex of the four elements (fire, water, air, earth) swirling together in perfect harmony."

# Card back alt text
[alt_text.card_backs]
flames = "A dynamic pattern of red and orange flames swirling around a central spark"
embers = "A dark background with scattered glowing embers and occasional small flames"
```
